By now you are wondering what gives me the right to talk about tech in healthcare. 

You have the gift to see complex things at a macro level
My college professor questioned my motivations for attending medical school. “There are many ways to help people. You can be a policymaker. You can be a scientist and develop drugs. You can be many things.” He told me that I had the gift to understand complex processes. After all, I was the top student in his cell biology class. Cell signaling is complex and not everyone can wrap their head around it. Below is a diagram from my cell biology notes to show you just how complicated a single cell’s processes can be.

My professor was onto something. What he did not tell me was that I was not very good at articulating what I see in my head to others, which is something that I have continued to hone and develop in my years as a product manager. I enjoyed complex problems and some of my favorite moments when I was building hospitals were me taking a huge piece of craft paper the size of a six-seater dining table and writing down every single clinical process by hand to make sure what I designed flowed nicely from one setting to another setting. The hospital was the cell in my head. Each player was a protein that interacted with other proteins. I could see how things would play out in a time series. I could rewind and play it again if a different decision was made. 

## More than a builder

People like to identify themselves as a creative or builders. If I had to pick a word, I would be an investigator. I like to ask a lot of whys and the moment I see that the whys don’t align with what we are doing then I set out to change things. That was not popular at all in the healthcare setting. People did not want you to ask why. They wanted you to follow orders and just execute. I asked too many whys and I felt stifled in a place where things were not running optimally and rules were set by registrars who were not clear on why certain things were done in a certain way. 

To digress a bit, my plastic surgery consultant once told us a story of a black cat and the monastery. The story goes that there is a monastery that has a cat tied to a tree. If you asked the monks why it is so, they will tell you it is good luck and has religious reasons. One day they did some investigation and realized that the cat was tied to a tree so the original monk could sweep up the fallen leaves without the cat messing up the pile of fallen leaves. You get the picture. The original intent was lost in time and no one ever questions why. That is healthcare in a fable for you. 

In medical school, I embarked on a project on the cost-effectiveness of gestational diabetes screening. Unlike other research projects my classmates had, I had to be the one to define the scope of the project and even the method of analysis. My research mentor gave me all access to the gestational diabetes clinic and the connection to talk to the finance team to gather the information. I settled on decision analysis and used Markov modeling to do my research project. Little did I know that those were considered Ph.D.-level techniques until I went to get my MPH later in life.

There were plenty of tears and arguments for this research project with my mentor. The initial phase was like I don’t see why you are trying to change how we do screening in gestational diabetes. Why are you trying to destroy our processes? The high-risk screening was good enough for us and people are getting treated. When I put on my investigator hat, I realized that the UK adopted the high-risk screening strategy, meaning only those with a particular list of patient characteristics would be screened, because they did not have enough resources to screen so many people. To keep costs down in their system, they struck a balance and went with the mama bear’s porridge option of high-risk screening. Singapore’s population has a significantly higher percentage of Indians (9.1% instead of 2%). We know Indians were at a higher risk of gestational diabetes so why aren’t we doing more to catch them early. Why aren’t we screening every pregnant woman knowing that 40% of women with gestational diabetes would convert to type 2 diabetes later on in life?

## Fight for others to see what I see

My project was so complex that most people did not understand how I did my analysis. Clinical researchers nodded as I sped through my presentation but I could tell based on the question that they asked that they did not understand a thing. The same thing happened when I walked into the boardroom full of male obstetricians, pediatricians, and neonatologists. I could see an emeritus professor dozing off from the corner of my eyes in the dark boardroom that seemed to swallow my voice. My mentor has arranged for me to “enlighten” the clinicians who were three times my age on what I have found. As they asked me questions unrelated to the project that I have spent the last two years of my life on. Staring toward the back of the room, I had the epiphany that they did not care about my research and how novel it is. They cared about what impact it would have on their clinical processes. Is it going to create more work for them? 

People care about patients in an abstract sense. When policy and guidelines changed, they wanted to hold on to the cat and continue to tie the cat to the tree even if it is irrational. Being an iconoclast is lonely sometimes but I had the taste of a win when the board on gestational guidelines bought into my argument that this is the right move because many European countries are starting to reevaluate screening strategy and Singapore could lead the way with a small pilot to see how much added work there will be for the clinic staff. 

It turned out the sugar drink for oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) test that looks like Fanta is pretty cheap to procure and the clinic nurses (who were mostly women) were happy to take on more cases as they see a value in helping pregnant women get screening and treatment for gestational diabetes early in their pregnancy. The saga did not end there. I received a call from the Ministry of Health 1 year after the initial pilot and they asked me to explain my research in a concise term before they launched a national recommendation for universal screening. Today, every pregnant woman in Singapore that goes to a public hospital will drink the Fanta-like bottle to determine if she has gestational diabetes. 

It made me happy that one of the professors from school benefitted from my work. She was not a high-risk patient for gestational diabetes and would not have received screening or treatment if I did not investigate and did not ask the series of whys. Similarly, one of my husband’s coworker’s wife had a similar tale. I know the complex decision tree that I saw in my head was worth pursuing because it touched lives around me. 

## A Change Agent

Great teachers see in you something you don’t see in yourself. My ex-boss who was my mentor in medical school for four years wrote on my residency application letter that I “can change the world”. I am not close to changing the world but I am trying hard to change things for the better at scale. Being a doctor on the ground for many years, I see the frustrations from a relative when he misses a critical phone call from the medical team about his mother. I see the devastation that a fellow house officer felt when a mistake happens due to miscommunication or a poorly designed IT tool. I see the frustration that physical therapists have when the medical team does not read their clinical entry on a patient who has an ambulatory issue and is not fit for discharge. Healthcare is a machine and it will keep running even if the people running the machines are getting burned out and jaded. After working on hospital-wide hardware and software implementation while building a new hospital, I pivoted to innovation evaluations and now I am a product manager at the experimental unit in Singapore’s Government Technology Agency which is the equivalent of U.S. Digital Services.
