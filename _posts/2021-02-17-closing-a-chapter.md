I look 6 months longer to finished my MPH because I had a kid during the summer semester. The younger me would have made a fuss over time lost to reach the pinacle of my career. The present me felt that time spent being happy is time well spent. 

2021 will be the year of change. 

* Changing job in March
* Graduation in May

Although I always wanted to explore the world beyond the public health, I felt sad leaving my colleagues at OGP. It was not the rage quit that I have always imagined in my head. I was not fedup with the bureaucracy to the extend that I would flip table and walk out of the office dramatically to announce to the world that "I quit".

Some people say public service is where people go to have a chill life for the rest of their life, but I found passionate individuals who care about citizens and patients they serve. They stay on even knowing it is difficult because it is the right thing to do. 

It is rare to find people who would always do the right thing even if people are not watching. I found a bunch of them and I truly believe that they can do great things.

There are many mountains in public service. With the help of the right people, things can change over time even if it takes a few generations to get the task done.
